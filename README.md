# QWERTYSH
A Simple Shell For *NIX, and maybe Windows

Based On github.com/brenns10/lsh

To build, type 'make all'
To uninstall, type 'make uninstall', then 'make clean'

# Dependencies:
- make
- gcc
- a Unix environment(Linux/Mac OS, etc.) to install/uninstall

Has **ONLY** been tested on macOS Sierra, with XCode/Command-Line Developer Tools! But I'm **PRETTY SURE** it'd work on most Unix-like/Unix-based systems.
